# Showcase-AI-Career-Guide
AI Career Guide is an innovative initiative currently under development, poised to revolutionize how students leverage their college-acquired skills for future career success. Our mission is to assist students in optimizing their skill sets for their dream jobs and desired companies using the power of artificial intelligence. We provide a personalized AI-driven roadmap to guide them toward their goals.

As we continue to develop this platform, we are actively seeking partnerships with industry leaders and respected organizations. Together, we aim to provide top-notch boot camp experiences to enhance students' readiness for their future careers.

At AI Career Guide, our commitment to nurturing the next generation of talent remains unwavering. We are dedicated to ensuring that students are exceptionally well-prepared to navigate the challenges and opportunities that await them in their professional journeys.
# How It Works
First, we create a comprehensive database of university courses and jobs by partnering with different organizations. For the MVP, we are keeping the course data in courses.json and jobs in the jobs.json file. Our server(sample_server.py), is used to make API calls to ChatGpt with the students' earned skills and skill requirements for the specific job and generate AI responses with appropriate roadmap for the students.<br>
For a sample response from our server, check out the full_suggestion.json file.
